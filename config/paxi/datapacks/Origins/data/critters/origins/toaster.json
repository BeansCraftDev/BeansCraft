  "description": "Toasters, often referred to as machines, printers and glorified pickaxes on legs, are half biological, half mechanical beings of unknown origin, built for the sole purpose of exploration, expansion and adaptation. Unfortunately, their programming has corroded throughout years, causing them to become self aware. They come in many shapes and sizes, often covered in fur, have multiple limbs or eyes. Finding two similar Toasters is nearly impossible."
